Football Player Stats Calculator
This project is a Python program that calculates the stats of football players based on their physical dimensions and other attributes. It saves the calculated stats in a more readable format in a txt file.

Prerequisites
This program requires Python 3.6 or later to run. You can download the latest version of Python from the official website: https://www.python.org/downloads/

Usage
To use this program, follow these steps:

Download or clone the repository to your local machine.
Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the project is located.
Run the program using the following command:
python FunFootballStats.py

Follow the prompts to enter the player's physical dimensions and other attributes.
Once all the information has been entered, the program will calculate the stats and save them in a txt file named 'player_stats.txt' in the same directory as the program.
How it works
The program uses classes to represent the different statistics of a football player. It then calculates the player's aditional stats based on these attributes using predefined formulas.

The program saves the calculated stats in a txt file in a more readable format. The file contains the player's name, height, weight, and calculated stats.
